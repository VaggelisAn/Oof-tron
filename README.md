# Oof-tron
Some things are better left unsaid...

This is my submission for Discord's Hack Week, a bot (on the shitpost category) that fills your voice chat with a words more elegant than Allan Poe's poems, more colorful than Picasso's paintings and more inspiring than instagram's influencers. 

### **Oof Bot's Commands**
- oof.help: shows all the available commands
- oof: Oofs you real hard. Arguments after the command: pitch level/oofs/chewbacca/demon/heliumed (personal favorite)/high/ultra_high
- bruh: Bruh
- za warudo: brpfbbbbbbbbbbb
- (This is so sad,) Alexa Play Despacito: Despacito but less worse and much better
- here come dat boi: oh shit waddup
- volume: Less ear-death
- prefix: Changes the prefix (must restart bot)
- leave: leaves the voice channel. Mostly used for debugging.

#### **Installation:**
- Install [python 3.5.3+](https://www.python.org/) &
- [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py) with pip install discord.py and pip install discord.py[voice]
- Open token.txt and enter your Bot's token.
